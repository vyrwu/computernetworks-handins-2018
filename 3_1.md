# Wireshark lab 3.1
COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET (ITCOM5 - FALL 2018) Assignment
## 1. Select one UDP packet from your trace. From this packet, determine how many
fields there are in the UDP header. (You shouldn’t look in the textbook! Answer
these questions directly from what you observe in the packet trace.) Name these
fields.

2. By consulting the displayed information in Wireshark’s packet content field for
this packet, determine the length (in bytes) of each of the UDP header fields.
3. The value in the Length field is the length of what? (You can consult the text for
this answer). Verify your claim with your captured UDP packet.
4. What is the maximum number of bytes that can be included in a UDP payload?
(Hint: the answer to this question can be determined by your answer to 2. above)
5. What is the largest possible source port number? (Hint: see the hint in 4.)
6. What is the protocol number for UDP? Give your answer in both hexadecimal and
decimal notation. To answer this question, you’ll need to look into the Protocol
field of the IP datagram containing this UDP segment (see Figure 4.13 in the text,
and the discussion of IP header fields).
7. Examine a pair of UDP packets in which your host sends the first UDP packet and
the second UDP packet is a reply to this first UDP packet. (Hint: for a second
packet to be sent in response to a first packet, the sender of the first packet should
be the destination of the second packet). Describe the relationship between the
port numbers in the two packets.
