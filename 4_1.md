# Wireshark lab 3.2
#### 1. Are DHCP messages sent over UDP or TCP?

Over UPD.

#### 2. Draw a timing datagram illustrating the sequence of the first four-packet Discover/Offer/Request/ACK DHCP exchange between the client and server. For each packet, indicated the source and destination port numbers. Are the port numbers the same as in the example given in this lab assignment?

I am only using the example from the lab assignment, so I cannot check.    

3. What is the link-layer (e.g., Ethernet) address of your host?
4. What values in the DHCP discover message differentiate this message from the
DHCP request message?
5. What is the value of the Transaction-ID in each of the first four
(Discover/Offer/Request/ACK) DHCP messages? What are the values of the
Transaction-ID in the second set (Request/ACK) set of DHCP messages? What is
the purpose of the Transaction-ID field?
6. A host uses DHCP to obtain an IP address, among other things. But a host’s IP
address is not confirmed until the end of the four-message exchange! If the IP
address is not set until the end of the four-message exchange, then what values are
used in the IP datagrams in the four-message exchange? For each of the four
DHCP messages (Discover/Offer/Request/ACK DHCP), indicate the source and
destination IP addresses that are carried in the encapsulating IP datagram.
7. What is the IP address of your DHCP server?
8. What IP address is the DHCP server offering to your host in the DHCP Offer
message? Indicate which DHCP message contains the offered DHCP address.
9. In the example screenshot in this assignment, there is no relay agent between the
host and the DHCP server. What values in the trace indicate the absence of a relay
agent? Is there a relay agent in your experiment? If so what is the IP address of
the agent?
10. Explain the purpose of the router and subnet mask lines in the DHCP offer
message.
11. In the DHCP trace file noted in footnote 2, the DHCP server offers a specific IP
address to the client (see also question 8. above). In the client’s response to the first server OFFER message, does the client accept this IP address? Where in the client’s RESPONSE is the client’s requested address?
12. Explain the purpose of the lease time. How long is the lease time in your
experiment?
13. What is the purpose of the DHCP release message? Does the DHCP server issue
an acknowledgment of receipt of the client’s DHCP request? What would happen
if the client’s DHCP release message is lost?
14. Clear the bootp filter from your Wireshark window. Were any ARP packets sent
or received during the DHCP packet-exchange period? If so, explain the purpose
of those ARP packets.
